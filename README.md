# Friend Finder
This application is a homework assignment for UNCC Bootcamp. 
FriendFinder is application that delivers a survey to the user asking to respond to a series of questions with a numerical value from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree). A difference value is pulled by comparing the user's responses to survey questions to the answers entered from previous survey respondents. The respondent with the least amount of difference calculated is shown as the best match to the current survey respondent and the name and photo of a previous respondent is returned to the browser.
